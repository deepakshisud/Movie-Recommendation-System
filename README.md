# Movie Recommendation System -ML Project
** A simple recommendation system built in Python. This is just the beginning for me in Machine Learning domain. This system is nowhere close to the industry stands, but it is a start.**

A recommender system is a simple algorithm whose aim is to provide the most relevant information to a user by discovering patterns in a dataset. The algorithm rates the items and shows the user the items that they would rate highly.
*Pearson Correlation* calculated based only on the ratings by the users in a user based collaborative filtering algorithm
